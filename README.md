# Static Site Base

This is the start for my web projects that tend to be static sites. This uses:
- 11ty to generate static files
- esbuild to compile JS/TS, and minify
- light-server to run dev server
- SCSS rarely ever used outside of imports
- PostCSS css post processing
-- CSSnano minification
-- Autoprefixer prefixer

## To Run
npm install
npm run dev
